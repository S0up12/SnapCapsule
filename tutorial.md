# 📚 How to get your Data

## 1. Request 'My Data'
Go to accounts.snapchat.com in your browser.
* Click on 'My Data'.
* **IMPORTANT:** Ensure 'Memories' is included!
* **FORMAT:** Choose **JSON** if prompted (though we now support HTML conversion).

[BUTTON:https://accounts.snapchat.com] Open accounts.snapchat.com

## 2. Wait for Email
Snapchat will email you when your data is ready. This can take anywhere from a few hours to several days for large accounts.

## 3. Download the ZIP
Download the ZIP file provided in the email link. Do **not** unzip it manually if you want SnapCapsule to handle the conversion and staging for you.

## 4. Process in SnapCapsule
* Come back to this **Home** tab.
* Click the **"Select ZIP & Process"** button.
* Select the `mydata~*.zip` file you downloaded.
* Choose a permanent folder on your computer where you want SnapCapsule to store your archive.

## 5. Staging & Memories
SnapCapsule will now:
1. Extract your files.
2. Convert all HTML logs to a unified JSON format (finding "missing" data).
3. Download your Memories from the Snap servers if you chose "Yes".

## 6. Launch
Once the progress bar is full, click **Save Settings & Launch** to browse your history!
